title: 0.2.3.1
---

#### Alpha release.
[https://github.com/Asnivor/MedLaunch/releases/tag/0.2.3.1](https://github.com/Asnivor/MedLaunch/releases/tag/0.2.3.1)

#### Notable Additions
* Fixed vb config option that was causing games not to launch
* Fixed crash on double-click of empty games library
* Fixed all context menu exceptions (null errors) on Games Library
* Fixed a master system config option (so games now run)
* Added 'Minimise to taskbar on Game Launch' settings option (default is ON)

#### Install
* Extract this release somewhere, run the executable and choose your Mednafen directory (must be the Mednafen 0.9.39.x branch). If you currently use system-specific config files with Mednafen it is recommended that you setup a new Mednafen folder (extract Mednafen to a new folder) to avoid issues.

#### Upgrade
* Starting with this version of MedLaunch you can safely extract this new release over an existing Medlaunch folder (providing you do not have MedLaunch running at the time).
* Run the MedLaunch executable and your current database will be upgraded before the application starts proper.
