#### Alpha release.
[https://github.com/Asnivor/MedLaunch/releases/tag/0.2.11.1](https://github.com/Asnivor/MedLaunch/releases/tag/0.2.11.1)

#### Notable Additions
* Minor bufix to update checker (it was reporting there was a new update even though there was not one)

#### New Install
* Extract this release to a folder, run the 'MedLaunch.exe' executable and choose your Mednafen directory (must be the Mednafen 0.9.39.x branch). 
* If you currently use system-specific config files with Mednafen it is recommended that you setup a new Mednafen folder (extract Mednafen to a new folder) to avoid issues.

#### Upgrade
* Preferred Method: Automatically download and upgrade using the 'Updates' tab within MedLaunch itself.
* Manual Method: You can safely extract this new release over an existing MedLaunch folder (providing you do not have MedLaunch running at the time)
* Once extracted run the MedLaunch.exe executable and your current database will be upgraded before the application starts proper.
