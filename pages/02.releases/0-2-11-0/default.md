#### Alpha release.
[https://github.com/Asnivor/MedLaunch/releases/tag/0.2.11.0](https://github.com/Asnivor/MedLaunch/releases/tag/0.2.11.0)

#### Notable Additions
* Fixed major issues with auto-game scraper (it actually works now and content is re-downloaded if it is already present)
* Added application colour theme picker
* Added option to check for MedLaunch updates on startup (but not auto-install) - disabled by default

#### New Install
* Extract this release to a folder, run the 'MedLaunch.exe' executable and choose your Mednafen directory (must be the Mednafen 0.9.39.x branch). 
* If you currently use system-specific config files with Mednafen it is recommended that you setup a new Mednafen folder (extract Mednafen to a new folder) to avoid issues.

#### Upgrade
* Preferred Method: Automatically download and upgrade using the 'Updates' tab within MedLaunch itself.
* Manual Method: You can safely extract this new release over an existing MedLaunch folder (providing you do not have MedLaunch running at the time)
* Once extracted run the MedLaunch.exe executable and your current database will be upgraded before the application starts proper.
