#### Alpha release.
[https://github.com/Asnivor/MedLaunch/releases/tag/0.1.12](https://github.com/Asnivor/MedLaunch/releases/tag/0.1.12)

#### Current Issues
* MedLaunch currently only works for ROM based systems as the CD image scanning import function has yet to be designed & implemented. Getting the disk-based systems (PSX, SS, PCFX etc) into the games library is currently the number one priority
* The launcher currently only handles absolute paths correctly. Relative path handling may or may not work but this part of the code needs a proper overhaul
* It is recommended that you use a brand new Mednafen instance for the time being. You can download the latest version of Mednafen from the Mednafen website. If you do not do this you might experience issues with already existing system specific configuration files in the Mednafen folder. Specifically, these will override base settings in MedLaunch until said system configuration is enabled in the launcher. This will be addressed in future releases.
