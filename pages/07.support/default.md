Documentation for MedLaunch is still to come (eventually).

Medlaunch is open-source software using the MIT license and as such, no formal support is supplied. However...

To file bug reports and feature requests/enhancements or if you want to contribute you can visit:

* The MedLaunch Github issues page ([https://github.com/Asnivor/MedLaunch/issues](https://github.com/Asnivor/MedLaunch/issues))

For general questions/chat (as well as the things above) please post in:

* The MedLaunch SubReddit ([https://www.reddit.com/r/MedLaunch/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MedLaunch/))

As a last resort you may be able to get hold of me (ASNiVOR) on the #mednafen IRC channel on freenode.
